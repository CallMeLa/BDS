BDS is dedicated to helping users using the language "BDScript" similar to JavaScript. Some of the files/code may contain JavaScript functions/commands, be sure to check the "Command language" found inside of the files. If you need help with coding JavaScript, Java, Python, BDScript, Kotlin, etc. Let me know and I'll try my best to help.
